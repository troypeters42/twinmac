# TwinMAC RTL notes

## Current status

- Date: Nov 4, 2026.
- Repository: C:\Users\petet\twinmac.
- Working branch: rtl, created locally from origin/main at 162764d.
- Step 1 is complete; Troy reproduced the passing test and approved it on Nov 4, 2026.
- Step 2 has not started. Troy authorized pushing rtl for step 1 review.

## Confirmed working decisions

Review each completed build step as a group of RTL, tests, scripts, and notes.
Commit the step after Troy approves it. Keep the original frozen arithmetic,
weights, pins, timing contract, and build order.

The weight shift register has no reset. Load all 72 bits before starting.
Reset clears the core's other registers and aborts an active run.
The core ignores start while running; callers keep inputs and weights stable.
The chip wrapper retains its specified rule that every start pulse clears
the sticky done flag, even if the core ignores that pulse. Callers wait for
completion before requesting another run.

Python expected-value calculations inside cocotb tests are allowed; a separate
Python model remains out of scope. Keep the OLED off until optional step 9.

## Step 1: clamp

### What hardware this describes

src/clamp.sv describes a combinational range limiter. Its input is the complete
signed 17-bit sum; its output is an unsigned 7-bit number.

- If the input is negative, output 0.
- If it is greater than 127, output 127.
- Otherwise, pass through the low seven bits.

Signed comparisons select between those three values. Every branch assigns
the output, so there is no latch. There are no registers, no clock input,
and no reset input. A clock edge does not move data inside this block:
its output responds to changes at its input after combinational propagation.
Later core registers will sample this output at their prescribed clock edges.

The comparisons must happen before taking the low seven bits. For example,
-1 has low bits 127 but must produce 0; 128 has low bits 0 but must produce 127.
Discarding upper bits first would give the wrong answer in both cases.
Values from 0 through 127 pass through exactly, without rounding.

### What the other files do

sim/tb_clamp.sv is simulation-only code. It visits every integer from -65536
through 65535 exactly once, drives its 17-bit representation, waits 1 ns for
the combinational output to settle, and compares with an integer reference.
The reference uses the candidate integer, never the RTL output. Case inequality
also treats any unknown output bit as a mismatch. Failures are counted;
only the first 16 mismatches are printed to limit diagnostic volume.

The exhaustive sweep includes every listed corner: -65536, -1, 0, 1, 127,
128, and 65535. It checks both saturation regions and every pass-through value.

sim/run_xsim.ps1 checks the source files and tool paths, then runs xvlog,
xelab, and xsim in order. A failed stage stops the run. Success requires
zero tool exit codes, exactly one testbench ALL TESTS PASSED verdict, and
no FAILED, ERROR, or FATAL diagnostics in tool output.

Vivado prints its own shutdown messages after the testbench's final verdict.
The runner preserves the raw tool logs, and also writes a combined verification
log that ends in ALL TESTS PASSED only after all checks succeed. It does not
treat simulator shutdown with exit code zero as sufficient evidence of a pass.

.gitignore excludes generated simulator files and the future fpga/build folder.
AGENTS.md contains the adopted handoff and the agreed workflow clarifications.

### Actual verification

Tool: Vivado Simulator 2024.2. Run from C:\Users\petet\twinmac:

```powershell
& .\sim\run_xsim.ps1 -Testbench tb_clamp -Sources @('src\clamp.sv', 'sim\tb_clamp.sv')
```

The command exited with code 0. The final lines of the combined log were:

```text
Checked 131072 signed inputs (-65536 through 65535).
ALL TESTS PASSED
$finish called at time : 131072 ns : File "C:/Users/petet/TwinMac/sim/tb_clamp.sv" Line 56
exit
INFO: [Common 17-206] Exiting xsim at Wed Nov  4 18:29:47 2026...
ALL TESTS PASSED
```

Actual output is retained locally in these ignored generated files:

- sim/logs/tb_clamp.run.log
- sim/logs/tb_clamp.xvlog.log
- sim/logs/tb_clamp.xelab.log
- sim/logs/tb_clamp.xsim.log

The runner was also exercised with temporary, deliberately invalid fixtures:

- No pass verdict: exit 1, rejected.
- FAILED: 1 followed by ALL TESTS PASSED: exit 1, rejected.
- SystemVerilog syntax error: exit 1 at xvlog, rejected.
- Missing source file: exit 1 before compilation, rejected.

The fixtures were written under the system temporary directory, not committed
as project testbenches. The observed guard-check summary is retained in
sim/logs/runner_guards.log; raw logs for the compiled fixtures are in sim/logs.
These are runner checks, not the design mutations reserved for step 7.

### Implementation decisions and tool findings

xvlog first rejected an implicit input net under default_nettype none
(VRFC 10-1103). The declaration now uses input wire logic signed [16:0].
This explicitly states the net kind and preserves the signed 17-bit port.

xelab then required a timescale on the design module because the testbench
has one (XSIM 43-4099). Both files now specify 1ns/1ps. This is a simulation
directive; it adds no hardware or latency.

No expected values or checks were changed to resolve either tool error.
Only xsim has been run; Icarus, Yosys, chip builds, and the board are unverified.
There are no unresolved questions for step 1. Troy independently reran the test,
reported ALL TESTS PASSED, and approved this step. The next planned block is the MAC unit.

## Step 1 review rerun (Nov 4, 2026)

Troy requested a fresh run before pushing rtl for review. The clamp section
above was checked and is present. The existing RTL, testbench, runner, and
expected values were unchanged. The following command exited with code 0
when run from C:\Users\petet\twinmac:

```powershell
& .\sim\run_xsim.ps1 -Testbench tb_clamp -Sources @('src\clamp.sv', 'sim\tb_clamp.sv')
```

The last 10 lines of its console output were:

```text
# xsim {tb_clamp_sim} -autoloadwcfg -runall
Time resolution is 1 ps
run -all
Checked 131072 signed inputs (-65536 through 65535).
ALL TESTS PASSED
$finish called at time : 131072 ns : File "C:/Users/petet/TwinMac/sim/tb_clamp.sv" Line 56
exit
INFO: [Common 17-206] Exiting xsim at Wed Nov  4 18:40:59 2026...
Verification log: C:\Users\petet\twinmac\sim\logs\tb_clamp.run.log
ALL TESTS PASSED
```

AGENTS.md now requires input wire logic and a 1ns/1ps timescale in every
SystemVerilog design file, and schedules deletion of src/project.v in step 6.
The existing clamp already satisfies both coding rules. Step 2 has not started.
